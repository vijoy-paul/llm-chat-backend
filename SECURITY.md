# Security Checklist

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the LLM Backend and provides a checklist for maintaining security.

## Implemented Security Measures

### ✅ Input Validation & Sanitization
- [x] Express-validator for request validation
- [x] XSS protection through content filtering
- [x] HTML tag removal from user input
- [x] Request size limits (1MB max)
- [x] Message length limits (1000 characters max)
- [x] Array length limits (1-50 messages)

### ✅ Rate Limiting
- [x] Express-rate-limit middleware
- [x] 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- [x] Proper error messages with retry information
- [x] Standard rate limit headers

### ✅ Security Headers
- [x] Helmet.js for security headers
- [x] Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [x] X-Frame-Options protection
- [x] X-Content-Type-Options protection
- [x] Referrer-Policy configuration

### ✅ CORS Configuration
- [x] Origin restrictions in production
- [x] Development vs production configurations
- [x] Credentials support
- [x] Preflight request handling

### ✅ Error Handling
- [x] Secure error messages (no sensitive data)
- [x] Proper logging without API key exposure
- [x] Timeout protection (30 seconds)
- [x] Graceful degradation
- [x] Structured error responses

### ✅ Environment Security
- [x] Environment variable validation
- [x] Secure API key handling
- [x] Production vs development modes
- [x] Configuration validation

### ✅ Dependencies
- [x] Updated to latest secure versions
- [x] Regular security audits
- [x] No known vulnerabilities

## Security Checklist for Deployment

### Before Production Deployment
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Configure `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` with actual domains
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set
- [ ] Test rate limiting functionality
- [ ] Verify CORS restrictions work
- [ ] Check security headers are present
- [ ] Test input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Verify error messages don't expose sensitive data

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Run `npm audit` monthly
- [ ] Update dependencies quarterly
- [ ] Review and update rate limits as needed
- [ ] Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Review CORS origins periodically
- [ ] Test security measures after updates

### Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor rate limit violations
- [ ] Watch for unusual request patterns
- [ ] Track error rates and types
- [ ] Monitor API response times
- [ ] Check for failed authentication attempts

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys or sensitive data to version control**
2. **Use environment variables for all configuration**
3. **Regularly update dependencies**
4. **Monitor logs for suspicious activity**
5. **Use HTTPS in production**
6. **Implement proper error handling**
7. **Validate and sanitize all user input**
8. **Use rate limiting to prevent abuse**
9. **Configure CORS properly**
10. **Keep security headers up to date**

## Incident Response

If you suspect a security issue:

1. **Immediately revoke compromised API keys**
2. **Check logs for suspicious activity**
3. **Update all dependencies**
4. **Review and strengthen rate limits**
5. **Consider temporarily disabling the service**
6. **Document the incident and response**
